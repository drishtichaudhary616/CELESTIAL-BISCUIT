    <p style="color: aliceblue;">While the Israel-Hamas conflict may appear to be a regional dispute, there are indeed larger players involved behind the scenes. Some experts suggest that the involvement of major global powers like China, Russia, the USA, and NATO adds a complex layer to the conflict. These superpowers have strategic interests in the Middle East, such as access to energy resources and maintaining geopolitical influence. They often support and influence various regional actors to further their goals. So, this conflict is not merely about Israel and Hamas; it's a reflection of broader global rivalries and interests in the region. Understanding these global dynamics is crucial for a deeper grasp of the situation.
